# Virtual Memory Paging Simulation

This project simulates four classic page replacement algorithms‚Äî**FIFO**, **LRU**, **Random**, and **Optimal**‚Äîto compare their performance in terms of page faults.

## üìò Overview

In operating systems, virtual memory allows programs to use more memory than physically available. When a needed page is not in memory, a **page fault** occurs, and a **page replacement algorithm** decides which memory page to swap out.

This simulation helps visualize how different algorithms perform given the same reference string and number of frames.

## üöÄ Features

- User input for number of page frames
- Default or custom reference string input
- Simulates and compares:
  - FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
  - LRU (Least Recently Used)
  - Random Replacement
  - Belady's Optimal Algorithm
- Reports page fault count and fault rate for each algorithm
- Performance analysis and best-performer highlight

## üõ†Ô∏è How To Run

g++ -o program4 program.cpp
./program4

### Input

- **Page Frames**: Number of physical memory slots (default: 3)
- **Reference String**: Sequence of page requests (default: `1 2 3 4 1 5 2 4 6 7 3 1 7 5 2 6 1 3`)

### Output

- Page fault count and rate for each algorithm
- Sorted comparison from best to worst
- Insights into algorithm efficiency based on simulation
